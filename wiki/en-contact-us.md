If you encounter serious problems with our site, like:

- ~~Crazy Zombie Dragons~~
- 500 errors on characters that 100% exists in the WoW Armory
- wrong pricing methods and item evaluations
- or anything else, real important

Follow this simple steps:

 1. First things first, breathe. It's important to breathe, otherwise human species dies.
 2. Report about it directly to our [GitHub: Conglomerat Repo](https://github.com/AlexZeDim/conglomerat-FRONT/issues) with full description and screenshots. 
 Of course, you'll need a GitHub profile for that. Try to use appropriate tags for that, like **BUG** and so on.
 3. In other, less priority cases, feel free to contract me in-game or via Discord:

Battle.net: `AlexZeDim#2812`
Discord: `AlexZeDim#2645`

Usually, I don't bite, and open to any conversations, proposals and negotiations.

P.S. Also, if you are a Guild Master from any Hall of Fame guild, or one of your character's name is something like: Scobomb, Maximillian or Alveona,
and you are requiring some special functional from site, which allows you to make progress race a bit easier, you could try to tag me on your own Discord server by mentioning.
