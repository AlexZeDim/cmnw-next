I guess this should be much easier to understand, then DMA...

This module is still in development, so covenant selection and any other features will come real soon.

## CHARACTER

Request information about character by its name and realm. And provide links to WoWProgress, Raider.io, Check-PvP and WoWArmory.

Also, shows: renames, faction / race / gender changes and guild events like promotions and demotions.

Nothing unusual.

## GUILD

The same as above, but for Guilds and without links. Shows players roster with their properties, like item level, guild ranking and hashes.

Also, guild logs allows tracking not just joins and leaves, but also promotions and demotions.

## HASH

Rumors said, that almost every character has a non-unique values, called `Hashes`, yet we don't know for sure does it help people to find their alts or will it be used in future or not.

But, if you know what to do, or it's interesting for you, you could try to search by hash value, or click on certain property from `GUILD` or `CHARACTER` table.
